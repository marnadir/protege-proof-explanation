This file is to record the changes in the project that will be reported
in the release history and release announcements. It is reasonable to keep
changes relatively high level to be understandable by the users but still
reflect the main changes made in the project.

	    <release version="${release.version}" date="${buildDate}" description="Changes since the last release">
	    	<action dev="pavel" type="add">
				Use Protege OWL Frame List to display proofs; axioms can be edited and deleted; proofs are expanded upon triggering the explain button.
			</action>
			<action dev="pavel" type="add">
				Highlight premises if an inference is selected in the list.
			</action>
			<action dev="pavel" type="add">
				Eliminate cycles in proofs: a proof for an axiom will not use this axioms as one of the premises.
			</action>
			<action dev="pavel" type="add">
				Update proof after changes in the ontologies without recomputing the proof: if an axiom is changed or removed it is removed from the asserted axioms of the proof.
			</action>	    	
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Simplify cycle elimination using the PULi library.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Define an extension point for proof services; add management of proof services in the UI.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Add a manager to keep track of the import closure to quickly check if an axiom is asserted.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Support axioms from import ontologies in proofs, including management of duplicate axioms (with different annotations).
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Reuse the display setting (e.g., row expansion state, selection) for proof parts remained after proof changes.
			</action>			
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Add tree-like navigation elements to the proofs UI; kept in synch with the current UI look and feel.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Support the standard Protege buttons for explaining, annotating, removing, and editing of axioms in proofs.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Distinguish between entailed (yeallow) and stated axioms in proofs; show this information in tooltips when placing the mouse pointer over the axioms.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Expand and collapse rows recursively after long mouse press or ALT + click; a recursive expansion limit is used to avoid UI lockup in cases with huge proofs.
			</action>	
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="update">
				Highlight the conclusion of the selected inference in the proof.
			</action>		
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Optimize rendering of proofs after expansion/collapse/resize by caching row heights values for list width values.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Display examples of inferences used in the proofs as tooltips when the mouse pointer is held over the inferences.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				A new option to remove unnecessary inferences in proofs using the PULi library.
			</action>
			<action dev="yevgeny" type="add">
				Use Protege keyboard shortcuts (e.g., undo, redo) when the explanation window is active
			</action>			
			<action dev="sea" type="add">
				Define an extension point for proof preferences.
			</action>
			<action dev="sea" type="add">
				Improve proof preferences panel by listing installed proof services and displaying their preferences in separate tabs.
			</action>

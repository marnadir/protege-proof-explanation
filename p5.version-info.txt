The Live Ontologies Project team is pleased to announce 
        the Protege Proof-Based Explanation 0.2.0 release!

This is a plug-in that adds proof-based explanation facilities to the Protege 
Desktop ontology editor. It registers as an extension to the Protege 
explanation services and defines an extension point using which OWL proofs can 
be provided by other Protege plug-ins. The main functionality of this plug-in 
is displaying, navigating, and updating those proofs in the user interface.

Changes in this version:
------------------------
New features:
- Use Protege OWL Frame List to display proofs; axioms can be edited and deleted; proofs are expanded upon triggering the explain button. 
- Highlight premises if an inference is selected in the list. 
- Eliminate cycles in proofs: a proof for an axiom will not use this axioms as one of the premises. 
- Update proof after changes in the ontologies without recomputing the proof: if an axiom is changed or removed it is removed from the asserted axioms of the proof. 
- Simplify cycle elimination using the PULi library. 
- Define an extension point for proof services; add management of proof services in the UI. 
- Add a manager to keep track of the import closure to quickly check if an axiom is asserted. 
- Support axioms from import ontologies in proofs, including management of duplicate axioms (with different annotations). 
- Reuse the display setting (e.g., row expansion state, selection) for proof parts remained after proof changes. 
- Add tree-like navigation elements to the proofs UI; kept in synch with the current UI look and feel. 
- Support the standard Protege buttons for explaining, annotating, removing, and editing of axioms in proofs. 
- Distinguish between entailed (yeallow) and stated axioms in proofs; show this information in tooltips when placing the mouse pointer over the axioms. 
- Expand and collapse rows recursively after long mouse press or ALT + click; a recursive expansion limit is used to avoid UI lockup in cases with huge proofs. 
- Optimize rendering of proofs after expansion/collapse/resize by caching row heights values for list width values. 
- Display examples of inferences used in the proofs as tooltips when the mouse pointer is held over the inferences. 
- A new option to remove unnecessary inferences in proofs using the PULi library. 
- Use Protege keyboard shortcuts (e.g., undo, redo) when the explanation window is active 
- Define an extension point for proof preferences. 
- Improve proof preferences panel by listing installed proof services and displaying their preferences in separate tabs. 
Changes:
- Highlight the conclusion of the selected inference in the proof. 


Have fun!
